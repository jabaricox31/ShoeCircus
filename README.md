# ShoeCircus

This project is made to imitate an e-commerce shoe store. On this web application, you can as a customer:
- Create an account
- Browse the catalog of objects
- Add and delete items from cart
- "Buy" these items
- Track your orders

This project also has an employee side. On the employee side you can:

- Update the inventory
- Add a new item to the inventory
- Process orders
- Update order details
- See all of the orders made

From this group project I learned:

- a deeper understanding of HTML/CSS
- how to connect an SQL database to a web application
- how to manipulate data from the SQL database to optimize the customer processes
- how to collaborate with others on a project relating to software
